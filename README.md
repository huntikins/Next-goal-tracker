## **Installation**

1. Click *Use This Template* to create a version of this project in your GitHub account and clone repository onto your local machine.

2. Run **``` npm install ```** or **``` yarn install ```** depending on your preference.

3. Update **```next.config.js```** with your MongoDb Atlas credentials, the base url is set to **```localhost:3000```**, this is the default port, but if that port is unavailable make sure you update that URL to whatever address your application is running on. ***[For help getting MongoDB credentials, refer to this guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/)***.

*Note that **```next.config.js```** is listed in **```.gitignore```** so that you don't push up any keys to GitHub. When pushing to production you will need to recreate these keys in your deployment environment.*
